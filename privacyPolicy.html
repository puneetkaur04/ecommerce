            <br>
            <p>
                At STUNNING SUITS, your privacy is very important to us.  We strive to ensure that your experience with STUNNING SUITS is one that you will want to repeat and share with your friends. 
                Part of our commitment to you is to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to us. The information below is designed to inform you of what information 
                we collect when you visit or make a purchase from the site, how it is used, how it is safeguarded, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are 
                installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to 
                the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
            </p>
            <p>
                - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier.
                - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
                - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, 
                payment information, e-mail address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information.”
            </p>
            <p>
                When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h4>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>

                Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
                <br>
